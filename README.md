# Social-Network-API

## Description
This is a project I built the APIs on the backend for a social network web application. Users will be able to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, and native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps. During the making of this project I learned that MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed and flexibility with unstructured data and being able to handle large amounts of unstructured data using a NoSQL database.
